Note, if set auto will be considered false unless explicitly set to true.\n * @property {number} [width] the width of the texture. Only used if src is an array or typed array or null.\n * @property {number} [height] the height of a texture.

If `src`\n *     is ArrayBufferView defaults to type that matches ArrayBufferView type.\n * @property {number} [wrap] Texture wrapping for both S and T (and R if TEXTURE_3D or WebGLSampler). Defaults to `gl.REPEAT` for 2D unless src is WebGL1 and src not npot and `gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE` for cube\n * @property {number} [wrapS] Texture wrapping for S. Defaults to `gl.REPEAT` and `gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE` for cube. If set takes precedence over `wrap`.\n * @property {number} [wrapT] Texture wrapping for T.

Defaults to 1.\n * @property {number} [premultiplyAlpha] Whether or not to premultiply alpha. Defaults to whatever the current setting is.\n *     This lets you set it once before calling `twgl.createTexture` or `twgl.createTextures` and only override\n *     the current setting for specific textures.\n * @property {number} [flipY] Whether or not to flip the texture vertically on upload. Defaults to whatever the current setting is.\n *     This lets you set it once before calling `twgl.createTexture` or `twgl.createTextures` and only override\n *     the current setting for specific textures.\n * @property {number} [colorspaceConversion] Whether or not to let the browser do colorspace conversion of the texture on upload. Defaults to whatever the current setting is.\n *     This lets you set it once before calling `twgl.createTexture` or `twgl.createTextures` and only override\n *     the current setting for specific textures.\n * @property {(number[]|ArrayBufferView)} [color] color used as temporary 1x1 pixel color for textures loaded async when src is a string.\n *    If it's a JavaScript array assumes color is 0 to 1 like most GL colors as in `[1, 0, 0, 1] = red=1, green=0, blue=0, alpha=0`.\n *    Defaults to `[0.5, 0.75, 1, 1]`. See {@link module:twgl.setDefaultTextureColor}. If `false` texture is set. Can be used to re-load a texture\n * @property {boolean} [auto] If `undefined` or `true`, in WebGL1, texture filtering is set automatically for non-power of 2 images and\n *    mips are generated for power of 2 images. In WebGL2 mips are generated if they can be. Note: if `level` is set above\n *    then then `auto` is assumed to be `false` unless explicity set to `true`.\n * @property {number[]} [cubeFaceOrder] The order that cube faces are pulled out of an img or set of images.

The image will be downloaded async. A usable\n *    1x1 pixel texture will be returned immediatley. The texture will be updated once the image has downloaded.\n *    If `target` is `gl.TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP` will attempt to divide image into 6 square pieces. 1x6, 6x1, 3x2, 2x3.\n *    The pieces will be uploaded in `cubeFaceOrder`\n *\n *    If `string[]` or `TexImageSource[]` and target is `gl.TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP` then it must have 6 entries, one for each face of a cube map.\n *\n *    If `string[]` or `TexImageSource[]` and target is `gl.TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY` then eact entry is a slice of the a 2d array texture\n *    and will be scaled to the specified width and height OR to the size of the first image that loads.\n *\n *    If `TexImageSource` then it wil be used immediately to create the contents of the texture. Examples `HTMLImageElement`,\n *    `HTMLCanvasElement`, `HTMLVideoElement`.\n *\n *    If `number[]` or `ArrayBufferView` it's assumed to be data for a texture. If `width` or `height` is\n *    not specified it is guessed as follows. First the number of elements is computed by `src.length / numComponents`\n *    where `numComponents` is derived from `format`. If `target` is `gl.TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP` then `numElements` is divided\n *    by 6. Then\n *\n *    *   If neither `width` nor `height` are specified and `sqrt(numElements)` is an integer then width and height\n *        are set to `sqrt(numElements)`. Otherwise `width = numElements` and `height = 1`.\n *\n *    *   If only one of `width` or `height` is specified then the other equals `numElements / specifiedDimension`.\n *\n * If `number[]` will be converted to `type`.\n *\n * If `src` is a function it will be called with a `WebGLRenderingContext` and these options.\n * Whatever it returns is subject to these rules. So it can return a string url, an `HTMLElement`\n * an array etc...\n *\n * If `src` is undefined then an empty texture will be created of size `width` by `height`.\n *\n * @property {string} [crossOrigin] What to set the crossOrigin property of images when they are downloaded.\n *    default: undefined.

That means **ANY MANIPULATION OF ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER or ATTRIBUTES**\n *   will affect the Vertex Array Object state.\n *\n * > Call `gl.bindVertexArray(null)` to get back manipulating the global attributes and ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER.\n *\n * @param {WebGLRenderingContext} gl A WebGLRenderingContext\n * @param {module:twgl.ProgramInfo|module:twgl.ProgramInfo[]} programInfo a programInfo or array of programInfos\n * @param {module:twgl.BufferInfo} bufferInfo BufferInfo as returned from createBufferInfoFromArrays etc...\n *\n *    You need to make sure every attribute that will be used is bound.
